 * Detects features in an intensity image as local maximums.  The extractor can be configured to ignore pixels

 * Almost all feature extraction algorithms use a threshold to determine what can be a feature or not.  Pixels
 * whose intensity is less than the threshold cannot be a feature.  This interface allows the threshold to be changed,
 * which is useful in scale-space analysis where the threshold will vary for each level.  In addition, if
 * a pixel has an intensity of Float.MAX_VALUE then it is ignored and not returned.  This technique is often used to
 * ignore features which have already been detected.
