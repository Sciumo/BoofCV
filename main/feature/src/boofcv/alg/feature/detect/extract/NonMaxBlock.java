/**
 * <p>
 * Non-maximum extractor based on the block algorithm in [1].  The worst case complexity per
 * pixel is 4 - 4/(n+1) where n is the region size.  The algorithm works by breaking up the
 * image into a set of evenly spaced blocks with their sides touching.  The local maximum is
 * found inside a block and then the region around that maximum is examined to see if it is
 * truly a local max.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each block check is independent of all the others and no information is exchanged.  This
 * algorithm could be paralyzed easily and has no memory overhead.
