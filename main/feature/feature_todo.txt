- Associate
 * Clean up interface and make it more elegant

Trackers
- Detect region/normalized cross correlation

- Modify BRIEF/BRIEFSO to compute descriptors with features partially outside image like in SURF

- Faster association
  - FLANN?

- See KLT list

- Canonical Radius
  * FH detector is probably incorrect
  * Make sure trackers use canonical radius and add a tuning parameter to scale up or down
    - This will allow detectors to be swapped with less problems
  * See ExampleInterestPoint.  The returned InterestPointDetector.getCanonicalRadius() is too large in SURF
  * Display shows what is visually pleasing to a person.  Descriptor needs a radius that corresponds to the area
    that it samples.

- BRIEF association
 * Look up table for hamming distance to speed things up

- Non-maximum suppression extraction
 * Non-Maximum Suppression for edges
   - Add a crude version 4 which just checks to see if gradient is > or < 0 to pick direction of line
 * Add sub-pixel using a polynomial fit

- Canny Edge Detector
 * Uses generalized algorithm for non-max right now.  It should use a specialized one for speed that traces
   the edge intensity and direction

- Add whole image detection capability to SSD detectors
 * Hunt through code where it expands the avoid border
 * Main reason for adding image borders is to avoid this headache.

- Ignore Borders
  * WrapperKitRosCornerIntensity: add ignore border parameter for when the derivative has an ignore border?
  * WrapperLaplacianBlobIntensity: same

- InterestPointDetector
  * change scale into size or radius in pixels so its not detector dependent
  * Would need to update descriptor interface to accommodate this change, DescribeRegionPoint

- Hough Detectors
  * Used round to reduce round off error?  Right now it is equivalent of floor
