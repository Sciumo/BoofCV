/**
 * <p>
 * Image pyramids represent an image at different resolution in a fine to coarse fashion. Lower layers
 * in the pyramid are at a higher resolution than the upper layers.  The resolution of a layer is
 * specified by its scale.  The scale number indicates how many pixels in the original input image
 * correspond to a single pixel at the current layer.  So a layer with a scale of 5 is 5 times lower
 * resolution than the input layer.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage: Before being used the scales in the pyramid must first be specified then the {@link @initialize}
 * function called.  How the scale is set is implementation dependent.  Once initialized images
 * at different layers can be accessed with {@link #getLayer}.
